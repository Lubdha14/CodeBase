JDBC
1. Type 4 = Thin Driver

2. How many transaction isolation levels provide the JDBC through the Connection interface?===>4
	TRANSACTION_READ_UNCOMMITTED	Dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads can occur.
	TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED	Dirty reads are prevented; non-repeatable reads and phantom reads can occur.
	TRANSACTION_REPEATABLE_READ	Dirty reads and non-repeatable reads are prevented; phantom reads can occur.
	TRANSACTION_SERIALIZABLE	Dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads are prevented.

3. method is static and synchronized in JDBC API?
	Ans:- getConnection()
4. 4 ways to load a database driver in JDBC:
	1. By creating an object of the Driver For example:
		sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver obj = new sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver();
	2. By sending the driver class object to the registerDriver() method of the DriverManager class. For example:
		DriverManager.registerDriver(new sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver());
	3. By sending the driver class name directly to the forName() For example:
		Class.forName("sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver");
	4. By using the getProperty() method of the System class.
		String dname = System.getProperty("driver");
		Class.forName(dname);

5. Which Interface provides the commit() and rollback() methods
	Ans: Connection Interface
6. Which of the following driver converts the JDBC calls into database-specific calls?	
	Native API-partly Java Driver (Type 2)

7. data type is used to store files in the database table?
	Ans: CLOB(Character Large OBject) .

8. JDBC provides only two types of ResultSets:=> Forward and Scrollable ResultSet.

9. statement to connect Oracle database using the thin driver.

	DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc::thin@localhost:1521:oracle", "scott", "tiger");

10. Data Source Name (DSN‚Äè) is a name given to the database to identify it in the Java program. The DSN is linked with the actual location of the database.

11. here are three types of ResultSet object:

	TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY: This is the default type and the cursor can only move forward in the result set.
	TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE: The cursor can move forward and backward, and the result set is not sensitive to changes made by others to the database after the result set was created.
	TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE: The cursor can move forward and backward, and the result set is sensitive to changes made by others to the database after the result set was created.


12.JDBC Net pure Java driver (Type 4) is the fastest driver because it converts the JDBC calls into vendor-specific protocol calls and it directly interacts with the database.

13. Type 1 driver is also known as the JDBC-ODBC bridge driver. 
14. JDBC driver can be used in servlet and applet both?
	Type 3 and Type 4.
